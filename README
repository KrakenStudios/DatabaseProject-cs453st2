    Fix accounts page to allow users to view own data
    ^^ Check: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/topics/auth/#django.contrib.auth.models.User ^^
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Allow users to view purchased products
    Allow users to view preferred customer statics (points, etc)

    Get search box working.. Maybe POST stuff? Check randy's examples to see if 
    something similar is there. If not, check the registration package in .local

    Fix product types...
    -- We need to have a way to store orders for users, and the items they bought
        -- also, the 'preferred customer' stuff needs to be somehow modeled
    
    -- Check out the django docs for models - they have a foreign key function 
       we may be able to use
    
    --if that's done, try getting stuff und ## ideas ## at least started

 Links from search direct to http://~~~/{games,movies,music,used}/{Product_ID}
    - then displays all info of item
    - same for listings on the {games,movies,used,music} page
